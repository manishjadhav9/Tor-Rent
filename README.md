# **Tor-Rent: Redefining Rentals with Blockchain!**

Tor-Rent is a fully functional, **decentralized rental application** that leverages **blockchain technology** to provide a secure, trustless, and transparent rental experience. It integrates **React** (frontend), **Node.js** (backend), **MongoDB** (database), and **Web3** (blockchain) while utilizing **Metamask for authentication** and **Polygon Ethereum for payments**.

---

## **Problem Statement**

Rental fraud, delayed payments, and disputes between tenants and landlords are frequent issues that lead to financial losses and legal conflicts. Traditional rental agreements are often prone to forgery, difficult to enforce, and lack transparency, making the process inefficient. **Tor-Rent** is a blockchain-based rental agreement system designed to ensure secure, tamper-proof, and automated contracts. 

By leveraging smart contracts, this system enables:
- **Transparent agreements** 📜
- **Automated payments** 💰
- **Built-in dispute resolution** ⚖️
- **Identity verification** 🔐
- **Self-executing enforcement** 🔗

This creates a **decentralized, efficient, and fraud-resistant ecosystem** for both landlords and tenants.

## **Key Features**

### 🔗 **Transparent and Immutable Agreements**
Rental agreements are securely stored on blockchain ledgers, preventing unauthorized modifications or tampering. Once recorded, the contract remains **permanent, verifiable, and legally binding**.

### 💰 **Automated Payments and Deposits**
Smart contracts automate rent payments and security deposits, executing transactions based on predefined conditions. This eliminates **delays, missed payments, and disputes over deposit refunds**.


### ⚖️ **Decentralized Dispute Resolution**
A built-in arbitration mechanism efficiently resolves rental conflicts. On-chain dispute resolution can involve **community governance or pre-assigned mediators**, reducing the need for costly legal proceedings.
